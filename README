WINBACK is a backup tool for Windows systems that simply copies files.

Coming from a unix background, this may not seem significant. It however
copies *any* file, regardless of permission. It will copy the file even
if it is open by other process. It will do so even on Windows 2000, and
without kernel patches or hooks, without a replacement filesystem driver,
and without even (technically) requiring Administrator access.

WINBACK can copy to another file, or it can copy to an FTP or SSH/SFTP site.
It can backup your registry, your IIS metabase, and your event log. It
copies them up as files to make cherry-picking simple, and to make it
*easy* to recover individual files.

It encodes your NTFS filesystem security into a file called Security.VBS
that can be used to partially or fully recover files.

WINBACK is also Free Software, and can be redistributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License.

To use it, run:
	winback.exe /all c:\ ssh://username:password@target/path/to/

You can also run winback.exe/help to get more information on how to back-up
individual things. If you want backups to be periodic, create a scheduled
task.

WINBACK works using the Windows Backup API, and decoding the streams directly.
If it fails to get access to a stream, it uses the Linux NTFS driver to
read the raw disk blocks directly to get at the version of the file on the
disk. If the target is an ftp:// url, it uses the WININET FTP system so it
will support your MSIE proxy settings. If the target is an ssh:// url, it will
use the included version of PuTTY to transfer the file. PuTTY is, however, very
slow, so this is not recommended.

WINBACK does *not* use the VSS, and so it can be used even in catastrophic
situations- perhaps from a recovery console.

LINBACK is a backup tool that works like WINBACK's FTP mode.

rotatedir.sh is a simple tool to rotate a couple backups using hard-links
to minimize disk space usage.
